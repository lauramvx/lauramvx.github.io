			<h2><b>Taylor, AB Guide to Music Theory</b> part 1 (<a href="taylor1.pdf">click</a>) part 2 (<a href="taylor2.pdf">click</a>)</h2>
			<p>here's the introductory book i talked about!<br>the first book, Part 1, starts off pretty basic, and Part 2 actually goes pretty advanced. for context, i used Part 1 in my intro singing lessons, and i used Part 2 studying composition at tech. after ch. 18 it gets into things specific to part-writing for strings, brasses and reeds, historically-informed performance and post-tonal harmony, which aren't necessarily relevant to you, so just read what's relevant or interesting (although you'd probably find some of that stuff cool).</p>
			<h2><b>Aldwell & Schachter, Harmony & Voice Leading</b> (<a href="aldwell.pdf">click</a>)</h2>
			<p>this would follow on from part 2 of the Taylor; while the title suggests the book is about a specific technique called 'voice leading' (arranging a melody with chords underneath), it actually covers most advanced functional harmony. you won't need this for a long time.</p>
			<h2><b>Barry Harris, Harmonic Method for Guitar</b> (<a href="harris.pdf">click</a>)</h2>
			<p>useful methods for conceptualizing guitar playing, within a jazz framework; primarily forming chords with drop voicings and chord substitutions. should be useful either immediately or after Taylor 1. Barry Harris taught John Coltrane and other well known jazz musicians.</p>
			<h2><b>Cook, Guide to Musical Analysis</b> (<a href="cook.pdf">click</a>)</h2>
			<p>for analyzing scores, if you want to do that. this isn't necessarily how modern musicology is done but it is traditionally taught.</p>
			<h2><b>How to Play from a Real Book</b> (<a href="rawlins.pdf">click</a>)</h2>
			<p>simple book that teaches you how to read a Real Book (scores for jazz standards).</p>
