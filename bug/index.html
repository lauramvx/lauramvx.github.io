			<p class="quote"><em>“A number of years ago, Dale Jamieson and I visited the distinguished Dutch ethologist Adriaan Kortlandt at his home in Oxford. He told us that ethology owes its existence to the ready availability of cheap field glasses after the first world war. Thus equipped, thousands of dedicated amateur bird watchers were able to observe behavior more closely than ever before.”</em> (Colin Allen)</p>

			<p><strong>Orientation:</strong> <em>epistemology, observation and cognitive penetrability</em><br>
			Colin Allen, 2004, <a href="allen.pdf">Is anyone a cognitive ethologist?</a>: a summary of the history of ethology and its theoretical basis; he stresses the primacy of observation.<br>
			Jerry Fodor, 1984, <a href="fodor.pdf">Observation Reconsidered</a>: a classic essay in theory of mind, still cited in neuroscience papers today. Defends the epistemological validity of observations in the face of the 'cognitive penetrability of perception', ie., how the things we believe affect what we see.<br>
			Powers et al., 2016, <a href="powers.pdf">Hallucinations as Top-Down Effects on Perception</a>: a contemporary neuropsychiatry paper which summarizes the debate on cognitivie penetrability and paints a picture of a perception that is indeed very penetrated by cognition.<br>
			Jack Lyons, 2011, <a href="lyons.pdf">Circularity, Reliability and the Cognitive Penetrability of Perception</a>: contains a novel argument that the cognitive penetration of our perception is not epistemically vicious because it makes our observations <em>more</em> reliable, not less.</p>
