	<body class="c7"><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well worn on the road and out of work, Claude makes over a low fence guarding a few acres of farm and steals up to the barn. There is a lul in the harvest during which she has to make a long and perilous trip; from as far south as Amn where she goes picking lemons in the early summer and sweating hard, then down to Tethyr where she would cut her knees picking strawberries until autumn ends, then nothing at all until the garlic comes up around Luskan in the late winter, during which time she hitchikes all the way back up on the Trade Way or stows away in canvas wagons or makes her way on foot and, in the night, sleeps in the loose hay of allotments like this. She smells the hay and shit and feels already at home as she shrugs off the latch on the barn door.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Inside it&rsquo;s a little space, only a little bigger than a cottage and it&rsquo;s cluttered with trade instruments: a big stiff plow that must be pulled by an ox, then hoes and pitchforks and shovels and a wheelbarrow and, in the corner, crowded out and covered in cobwebs for disuse in this season, a gristmill. But there are three stalls with some hay in, two of them empty and one, when she gets close enough to look into the black, sure enough features the steer for driving the plow. He sleeps on his side and doesn&rsquo;t move his head for Claude. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We hope that y&rsquo;will not mind our company, sir,&rdquo; she says. He bats something with his ear in his sleep. &ldquo;Only we are long on the road, y&rsquo;see, and Oh, well, in the dark, y&rsquo;never know who will be out along there.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She turns in to the next stall and sorts the hay into a little bed, ensuring not to take any dung along with it, and lies down on her back. &ldquo;Yessir,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;we would have come to knock on the door but couldn&rsquo;t find the house in the dark and, besides, was getting frightened in the night. You understand me, sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She watches mayflies passing across the roof supports in the moonlight that comes through, disappearing whenever a cloud must pass above them and coming back in their great numbers when the light repairs. &ldquo;Ah, well, I follow the harvest wherever it goes, sir,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I want to make my living only I don&rsquo;t want to end up on anyone&rsquo;s books. You understand me, sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She closes her eyes. &ldquo;Why, yessir, I am out of work, until the late months of this season and then much north of here, for there is no one farmer on this coast who will risk to employ a woman travelling from so far south. Yes, even at the price I&rsquo;ll work at, sir, as little as it is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She smiles to herself as the sleep comes. &ldquo;Oh, y&rsquo;will need help this winter with the animals, sir? And y&rsquo;have three adult daughters and no man around to marry them&hellip;?&rdquo; She drifts off to sleep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>She wakes up to the heel of a boot hitting her stomach, hard. She screams but chokes it for her dignity. She retches and looks up and sees the farmer, only his silhouette out against the morning sun, wearing a big hat and loose sack. &ldquo;You bastard,&rdquo; she says, bringing her hands up over her, but he brings his heel down hard on her stomach again and she chokes another scream. &ldquo;Fuck you,&rdquo; her voice hoarse.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He grabs her by the ankles and drags her out of the stall and into the middle of the barn. The steer retreats from the gate of its stall at the movement and noise but inches back up to see. The farmer kicks Claude in the side with the point of his boot and she now lets out her scream, unable to swallow it in time, and curls up and rolls over on her side. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now the farmer screams, a ferocious scream at the top of his lungs, and as he does he falls to his knees. It takes Claude by surprise who almost forgets the pain to look at him. He screams again and again, banging his fists on the ground. Claude waits for him to let up and to curse her and explain his rage but he doesn&rsquo;t. Once he stops screaming he punches her hard in the jaw. Once, twice, three times. She feels something break and blood fill her mouth. She spits. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; she tries to say, her blood spilling out on the ground. &ldquo;We think y&rsquo;thinking we were someone else, sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; the farmer says, his voice quiet but commanding, as he gets up on his feet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was&hellip; long on the road,&rdquo; she says between coughs and splutters, &ldquo;and couldn&rsquo;t find the house, sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The farmer comes back with a two-tined pitchfork in his hands and, placing his foot on Claude&rsquo;s chest, turns her over. He raises the fork into the air with both hands, &ldquo;wait, sir, no-&rdquo; and he brings it down on Claude. It sticks into the ground, one tine on each side of her neck, pinning her there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He continues to beat her for what feels like hours. The barn seems to Claude to fill up with darkness, and she thinks first that he has gone on all day and night has fallen again, but then she thinks that she is dying and the dark is death coming up to her. She can only hear his fists and heels on her body and her own groans until the steer begins to give out a loud and hoarse and high pitched call, as though begging the man to stop or for some other cow to come and help. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; yells the farmer who goes over and kicks the gate, making the steer back off into the corner. He kicks it again and swears, and swears again, then he comes back and drives his heel down on Claude&rsquo;s ankle. She screams terribly as she feels it all up her back, pain that feels like pulling bark off an old tree where it&rsquo;s come away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&hellip; what do you want,&rdquo; she asks him, &ldquo;you bastard?&rdquo; She can no longer see anything in the dark, and at this point the farmer comes back to her with a bundle of rushes which he has lit on the end with a tinder. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Now that she can see him clearly she realizes he isn&rsquo;t a farmer like any she&rsquo;s seen before. His skin is deep red and he has iron horns coming from the sides of his head, and his eyes are black as pitch. He&rsquo;s a young man, younger than her, and his lips are black, as are his hands up to his forearms like they&rsquo;re covered with ink.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; she thinks. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t be a farmer at all to look this way, would you be?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The demon looks her in the eyes now for the first time and gives her a little smile which to Claude seems guilty. &ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he says, his voice quiet and calm. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you doing to me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He remains silent and pulls a leather purse from under his shirt. When he opens it Claude is overpowered by a sickening, sweet smell of rotting fruit, worse than she had ever smelt before though she had been picking fruit for years. Nausea clutches at her stomach and she tries her best to fight it down. The demon reaches into the purse and pulls something out; it looks like an acorn, but soft and dripping wet and covered in a white furry mold. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He goes over behind her head and kneels over her, and she wants to ask what he will do but feels stiff and starts to shiver. He puts his hand on her cheek and she closes her mouth and eyes of fright. He slides one finger in between her lips and searches around in her mouth; he manages to pry it in between her teeth though she bites down hard, and soon forces open her mouth. He covers up her face with his hand spread out but for the fingers he uses to keep her mouth open, and in her weakness she cannot fight him off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He places the rotten thing in her mouth. She twists, trying to free herself and to fight against his hands and spit it out, but he holds her mouth closed with the thing in there and she can&rsquo;t resist him. &ldquo;Swallow it,&rdquo; he orders, but she won&rsquo;t. He punches her in the stomach. She can no longer fight the nausea and she pukes. There is nothing in her stomach to bring up but bile as a thin liquid which burns like acid and clings to her throat, but it forces the rotten seed from her mouth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The demon repeats the procedure, forcing it into her mouth again and holding it shut. They go on wrestling like this, her choking and vomiting until in the end she succumbs and swallows it. He stands and removes the fork to let her wretch and convulse and vomit, for she won&rsquo;t bring it up again now that it&rsquo;s gone in. It clings to her stomach and forces itself down. She digs her hands into the ground and feels the earth under her fingernails. She grabs at her stomach as if to stop it. It forces itself down into her gut and there plants itself. She feels it like a galstone which has become stuck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After she stops fighting and lies without moving and her breaths become soft the demon again kneels down to her and places a hand on her cheek. &ldquo;Soon you will dream and there Moander will visit you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do as he says and the Eating From Within will not take you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claude doesn&rsquo;t say anything and he leaves her there to lie in the barn. The darkness spills out of the door as the day returns and a cold breeze comes over her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>~~~</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claude wakes to the sound of a calling cock and everywhere around is yellow with the morning haze. She supposes that she has slept in through the day and night and was awoken the next morning. She lies still for some time further and then rights herself and nervously peers out of the door to the byre, hoping not to see the farmer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The barn is up on one hill and, far enough away that she had missed it in the dark, the house is up on another. It looks dilapidated, as though unused for centuries, and overgrown with brush, and all around the grass on that hill is tall and covered by clovers and cress. She finds herself too curious of the old house and goes over to it, though she should have left well enough alone and ran for the road; but, sure enough, the house is empty. Each chamber of the house is overgrown and disused and there are no animals save for the spiders and beetles that come in on the ivy, not even the cock that woke her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claude sits in the house for some hours taking its measure. Finally she reasons that it was surely abandoned and, bitter of the road, she would stay here and farm until the demon comes back to kick her out. She lets the steer out of the barn and takes it and a hoe up to the house and there she clears the weeds. The house is divided up into a spacious communal room with a fire and chimney, a kitchen with a deep larder, and three bedrooms. All of the furniture is in disrepair so Claude moves it outside and in the bedrooms she lays hay. The steer she would give the master bedroom for it was the largest and had a back door that opened onto the hill, then she would take the room next door. However, not knowing how to direct him, he would follow her wherever she went and not stay in his room, so Claude would lie down in the hay in the master bedroom and wait for him to lie down with her. When she heard his breaths become shallow and regular, and see his ear twitch as though to discourage a fly, then Claude would rise and, straining not to wake him, retire to her own cell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Every morning the cock calls and wakes Claude, though she can never find it around the house; she reasons that it belongs to a neighbouring farm that she cannot see around for the hills. After waking, Claude turns her attention to her stomach. Though the house is abandoned the larder is stocked, so on the first day Claude eats bread and boils the eggs, and on the second day roasts the oats and prepares meal, and on the third day she eats the bacon and salted fish that had hung there. Each time she feeds herself the steer would stand by the table in the kitchen and watch her eat, drooling all over the floor and licking his lips, and Claude would ignore him and go on eating. Then she would take him out to the pasture and let him graze while she lay in the sun and slept, warm enough in the better months before midwinter. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>On the fourth day she toasts the last of the bread and on the last day she chews on grains she finds in a sack at the back of the larder and then complains to the steer, &ldquo;we have no more food, though you are well fed with clovers and cress.&rdquo; She puts her boots up on the table and tilts her hat over her face. &ldquo;On tomorrow we&rsquo;ll get to the village and get our food, and get winter seeds to plant, were I to find anything to sell, and then y&rsquo;may pull the plow again.&rdquo; She falls asleep that way.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The next day she searches the house for valuables. She takes the rug of the main room, the covers that hung over the tattered bed, and the curtains from over all the doorways, considering them good to sell. She wraps them in sack and rope and fastens them to the steer by a yoke, and puts reins around him. &ldquo;Come on then,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;the village is half a day away and we&rsquo;ll want to catch the market.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">~~~</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After a long walk on unmarked road the village comes up on the horizon. It&rsquo;s covered by a canopy of thatched and tiled rooves mixed together, with a clear space in the middle flocked by market stalls. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in time,&rdquo; says Claude, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t tarry now.&rdquo; They rush down into the market and, for the first time in many years, Claude does not draw looks from any villagers for they take her to be another hawker for the farmer&rsquo;s market.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She unwraps the cloth and shows her fabrics to the vendors, some offering her a price. &ldquo;What is a good price for fabrics?&rdquo; she asks the steer, and he snorts. She gets a price from everyone and sells it to the highest bidder, which is about ten silver pieces for it all. After the sale is done and the farmer packs the fabric into his wagon, Claude takes him aisde.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sorry, sir, to trouble y&rsquo;more, only we&rsquo;re a new farmer, and would look to win some advice.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The farmer considers her request and at last shrugs his shoulders. &ldquo;No harm may come by it,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;What do you need to know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, sir, we need to know the right way to, uh&hellip; plant seeds.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The farmer looks at her for what Claude considers a lot too long, though she goes on smiling and holding her hands together behind her back, doing what she thinks a well-trained country girl might have done. &ldquo;To plant the seeds?&rdquo; he says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;And which seeds to plant, sir. And how to tell a steer what to do so as he&rsquo;ll listen. Sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The farmer gives her another very long look but at last assents. &ldquo;Soon it&rsquo;ll be highsun and I&rsquo;ll pack things away. Why don&rsquo;t I come down to the farm and see what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No!&rdquo; says Claude, thinking about the mysterious circumstances she acquired the farm by. &ldquo;Uh, we wouldn&rsquo;t take up so much of your time, sir, as we are sure you must be busy.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The farmer shrugs again and tells her to come back at highsun and he&rsquo;ll tell her all she needs to know; so she goes around and quickly buys what food she needs - some loaves of bread, some cured meats and salted fish, and some grains, but in her hurry forgets the eggs. She rushes back to the farmer, who does tell her everything; how to train the ox to follow her orders, how to plow and how to sow, what seeds will grow in winter and which of those have the fastest turnover.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now that I&rsquo;ve told you all this,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;you must agree to one thing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Anything, sir,&rdquo; she says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Til next midwinter you&rsquo;ll only buy the seeds from me, and the crops you grow you&rsquo;ll only sell to me, at the price I offer, so we aren&rsquo;t to compete here at the market.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claude agrees, thankful to have sure sales, and after they shake hands she asks for an advance on the seeds, &ldquo;as I have spent the last of that silver on food, sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The farmer groans but agrees, seeing Claude&rsquo;s issue, and gets her the seeds. He tells her that they&rsquo;ll come up in eight rides, then he quickly leaves. &ldquo;We had better go along too,&rdquo; Claude says to the steer, counting up the four silver she has left.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;[&lsquo;NO DREAMS&rsquo; scene!!]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">~~~</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When they get back Claude goes into the larder and throws in the bags of grain, then hangs the fish and the meat, but she stops before she places the loaves of bread when she notices there a basket full of big, brown eggs. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I forget you&hellip;?&rdquo; she says. Nevertheless, she boils one to have with bread that evenfeast and finds it to be fresh, so she doesn&rsquo;t complain about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The next day, after the steer&rsquo;s grazing, Claude fixes the plow to his yoke and holds it from the other end, and together they break up the soil on the hill around the barn; then Claude comes over with the seed-bag and sows the fieldings. After the hard work she lies down in the grass on the other hill and admires the mud they made. &ldquo;You and me, huh&hellip;?&rdquo; she says, looking up at the steer. &ldquo;If people wouldn&rsquo;t think we were a couple of farmers!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At the end of that ride the larder is emptied again and Claude is up late looking for more things to sell. She takes out some old clothes from a cupboard in the master bedroom and finds some dresses. They&rsquo;re plain and made of thick chiffron, but in mauve and woad and other colours Claude considered unusual. She also finds some wooden broaches with brass pins, and thinks these are all good enough to sell. At the market all goes the same, although the farmer is unhappy to see her and she thinks it best to sell her goods somehwere else; and this time when buying her food she remembers the eggs, and, the steer having eaten through much of their beds, she spends the last of their silver on fresh hay. Once they are back Claude again throws in the grains, hangs up the meat and is again surprised to find a basket of big, brown eggs already there. &ldquo;Now I know something is amiss,&rdquo; she says, looking at the eggs she bought, which now seem smaller and less appealing. &ldquo;That cock must be around here, though I weren&rsquo;t to find it, and with his own harem. I should be selling eggs, not buying them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">On the third ride when the food runs out again Claude takes the house apart looking for more to sell and cannot find anything valuable, even under the floorboards or behind the wooden walls of the larder. She exhausts herself looking and at last gives up, thrashing her fists on the wooden table in the kitchen, after which the steer runs into his bedroom to hide his head. She thrashes again, and again, and then falls asleep in the gloaming with her head on the table. The next day she lies in her bed all day and listens to her stomach grumbling, except for when the steer comes in to lick her face, and when it&rsquo;s dark and the steer is asleep she slips out of the house.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">~~~</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arriving in town in the dead of night Claude avoids the market and wanders around behind the houses, selecting those with tiled rooves and peering over their fences. After she has done peering over one fence and drops down to the path she finds a girl standing beside her; the girl wears rags and a wind-beaten cap and carries all her belongings on her back. Claude startles, having made her spying so obvious, but soon realizes that the girl is oblivious. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Excuse me, sir,&rdquo; says the girl, &ldquo;if you will spare some time to hear me, though the hour. I am young and blinded by an affliction. There is no work, and-&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claude cuts her off. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t give me all that, miss, for I know how it all goes on this coast. Where are you sleeping?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; says the blind girl, giving a polite curtsey. &ldquo;In a bush someplace, and not always the same one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How will it sound to you to enter a farmer&rsquo;s stewardship?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I will say, Oh! Praise Lathander! Long have I wandered, putting my head whererever the ground may accept it-&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aye, aye. Stay just where you are until we were back for you, then to my farm and I&rsquo;ll show you where y&rsquo;may sleep. Only an hour, then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claude walks a few streets away out of earshot of the girl and repairs her spying. At last she finds a house she deems suitable and makes over the fence, disposes of the latch and, holding her breath, closes herself into the larder. She empties out a bag of grain and fills it with bread and cured meat the sort she had been buying before, and then fresh vegetables and fresh fruit from all over Faerun, and some bags of sugar and other ingredients, and then makes off with her sack. She rinses three or four other homes before returning to the blind girl and, taking her by surprise, hands her a heavy sack. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Y&rsquo;may carry this one,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;The walk is long.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They march home wordlessly, the blind girl following the sound of Claude&rsquo;s footsteps and whatever knocks around in the sacks, and they say nothing except to heave and sigh. At last they get up to the house as day breaks in time to hear the cock&rsquo;s call. Claude worries that the girl will be suspicious when she cannot find the cock. They set down the sacks in the kitchen and Claude takes her around the house.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;The steer sleeps in here for the space and the door,&rdquo; she says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it do in that byre?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Ah, yes, but&hellip; this way I might keep an eye on him. This one is mine. Y&rsquo;may take this room. Let me get some hay for it&hellip;&rdquo;</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The girl walks in and runs her hands over the walls and on the floor, noticing the cracks and the weeds coming through, this way coming to know the derelicition of the house. &ldquo;You live this way?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claude blushes. &ldquo;I thought y&rsquo;had been sleeping in a bush, and not always the same one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It seems I am about to keep on doing so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They retire to their beds and Claude wakes up after highsun to the steer licking her face. &ldquo;Aye, yes, sir,&rdquo; she protests, &ldquo;yes, alright,&rdquo; trying to push its head away as it fights her to go on licking. She rights herself and comes into the center room and finds the blind girl already sitting there. She has made a soup which now broils at the edge of the fire, and she drinks it slowly. She removed her heavy, well-worn coat and hat and now wears only a short tunic. Her silver tresses fall down over her dark shoulders and getting to see her this way Claude is struck by her beauty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Where do you bathe?&rdquo; the blind girl asks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claude again blushes. &ldquo;Well&hellip; with all of the work of setting up a farm, y&rsquo;see&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The blind girl laughs. &ldquo;There must be a river.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That day they go out looking. The blind girl says she knows a prayer for finding rivers and she sings it as they walk and, sure enough, over the next hill they come on the channel. Seeing the water Claude awakens to her thirst and gets on her knees to drink, and when she comes up she notices that the blind girl has already undressed. She blushes and covers her eyes to protect the girl&rsquo;s modesty but the girl never submerges, instead standing in the river and rubbing herself down with a rag. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You must come and bathe,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Otherwise I won&rsquo;t come back with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claude sits for a few more minutes but then says, &ldquo;what harm might come by it?&rdquo; and undresses herself. She quickly submerges in the water for worry that the girl had lied about her affliction and would notice her dick stiffen. She washes herself in the water next to the blind girl and at first she averts her gaze but can no longer resist it and looks up at her. From that moment she can no longer take her eyes away from the girl. Every day they come to the river to bathe and collect water and Claude brings herself as close to the girl as she can get so she might feel her warmth in the water on her naked body and, though it were shameful, she looks up at her breasts, how they move as she scrubs and squish up as she cleans her chest, and loses her footing on the river stones for being distracted. As she gazes on her she curses herself for the shame and wishes that she was not the girl&rsquo;s master; she imagines giving her the farm and becoming her servant instead, every day straightening each straw of her bed and sweeping the floor before her every step.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">One day they are drying off on the bank of the river when the blind girl asks after her name. &ldquo;Claude,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;from Tethyr, though I am a stranger there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You have a man&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; says the blind girl.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, where I were from it was a woman&rsquo;s name, and a man&rsquo;s name.&rdquo; After some time passes in silence Claude says, &ldquo;what of y&rsquo;own name?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Normally I am called Beggar, though once I was called Slave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claude feels as if she had been defeated in combat. She thinks, how does one go on asking, hearing these words? &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; she says, then curses herself for doing so. After more time passes she asks, &ldquo;where were you enslaved?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A Thayan enclave by Waterdeep. There I belonged to a sorcerer named Haucod and laboured for him.&rdquo; She rolls over to face Claude and lowers her voice as though telling her a secret. &ldquo;I would sneak off to their library and there, as I could yet see a small measure, would take a loupe and a candle and read books, letter by letter. I first taught myself to read their writing and then read every book I could. One day I was taken out to the fields and I ran, and I kept running until I couldn&rsquo;t breathe. I ran into a forest and became lost there, so I lived by foraging and I prayed to Lathander every day that he might deliver me to a river that I could follow. Every day I changed the way I asked until he did so, this way learning the right prayer for finding rivers. But once I left that forest I lost the rest of my vision, as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claude lies in silence for some more time and at last thanks her for sharing her story.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You are now obliged to tell me yours,&rdquo; the girl said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claude laughs. &ldquo;I had hoped t&rsquo;get away with it,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But already y&rsquo;will know about it. This one steals, and she always has. I am just one who is that way, and can do no other than steal. In Tethyr they would have cut apart my hands, but the priest took pity on me by my being poor, so they would only have my ears.&rdquo; She pauses for a long time. &ldquo;To a younger Claude it were intolerable and I murdered him. Then I fled and to avoid the law have followed the season around. But I am now sick of the road and would sooner die than walk on it. So I am in this old farm trying to make my living.&rdquo; She pauses for a long time and then says, &ldquo;if y&rsquo;should rather stop serving me for it I shall not try to stop you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t worry of your dagger unless I plan to have your ears.&rdquo; Claude laughs, showing her relief by her laughter, and the two lay naked on the bank a long time until the chill comes for them and they head back to the house.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That night Claude can not talk herself into sleeping and lies awake looking up at the moon through the holes in the roof and listening to the blind girl snoring. She imagines going in and lying in her hay pile and putting her hands on her, but then says &ldquo;it&rsquo;s shameful to think this way,&rdquo; so she gets up and goes to sit in the master bedroom with the steer. He wakes on her coming in and tilts his head up at her and she scratches his ear. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Will you keep a secret, sir?&rdquo; she says. He licks her boots. She speaks quietly so that the blind girl will not hear her. &ldquo;The other day I dreamt at last. I think Moander came in that dream.&rdquo; She looks up at the moon again and listens to the girl snoring to ensure she is still sleeping or pretending to sleep. &ldquo;I was on the road. I came upon a tree. It were not any special tree, though something made me look at it. I looked long at the tree and then I heard a rustling as if it were some burrowing animal. Then out of the tree a vine fell, and though I only saw it for a moment, I knew it was taken all the way through by rot, and that it was&hellip;&rdquo; she stops and covers her mouth and looks away from the steer for a while and then says, &ldquo;white all over like that thing. You saw it, sir. That demon said he would tell me what to do. Well, now he has come for me. But I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo; She covers her eyes for she has begun to cry, and she curses her dignity. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she says, choking up. &ldquo;I know he will eat me. I feel it in my belly, like it were hungry. And there is nothing now that may be done to stop it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">~~~</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Some night Claude is haunched over a bucket in the kitchen, stripped naked and covered in goosebumps. The bucket is full of water and the water has become deep red. She squeezes the water out of her jerkin, looks at it and sighs, wetting it again. Then she hears the blind girl come into the kitchen and she stops everything and holds her breath. The girl says nothing for some time and Claude must breathe or suffocate, so she gasps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What are you doing, though the hour?&rdquo; asks the blind girl.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Washing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Though the hour?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t sleep.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now I can&rsquo;t sleep.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claude apologizes and tries to go on washing but the girl stays in the kitchen and again probes about her washing. After enough questions Claude is convinced that the girl knows everything already by the work of some spell and she confesses. &ldquo;This one killed again tonight,&rdquo; she says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The two sit in silence for some time. &ldquo;I must clean the blood before one follows me to this house,&rdquo; she says and goes on washing. After minutes pass and the girl says nothing nor leaves, Claude turns to look at her; she sits, her knees tucked into her chest, shivering. Though she had up to now been such a master of herself, it occurs to Claude that she is frightened. Claude is struck by an agony. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It weren&rsquo;t my fault,&rdquo; she says, anger coming up in her voice, though she had not thought herself angry. Soon the girl leaves to her own bedroom and the two exchange no more words for a long time. As the sun rises and the sun falls, then rises and falls again, the only words spoken are between Claude and the steer as she praises him or discourages his tongue. Claude feels that she has dashed it all and the girl will soon flee, running from her as if she runs from a bugbear&rsquo;s cave. But then one night as she lies awake, tormented by the moonlight, the girl comes into her room right up to her hay bed and lies down next to her, tucking herself into her as close as she can get and pulling Claude&rsquo;s arm around her. Claude doesn&rsquo;t say anything but the girl must feel her heart beating as fast as a fleeing hare.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I saw a ghost,&rdquo; she says. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; says Claude. A few moments pass. &ldquo;A ghost?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A few more moments pass. &ldquo;You saw a ghost?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I saw a ghost whirling in my cell.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t mean any cruelty by it,&rdquo; Claude says, &ldquo;but we thought you had been blind, and could not see.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Only ghosts,&rdquo; she says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claude grips her very tightly and the girl settles into her embrace. &ldquo;This one will go look for it and scare it off,&rdquo; she says. The girl says nothing and Claude exits into the main chamber, but she stops before the room. Just now she allows her hands to tremble. She wants to tell the steer to go in and look first but her dignity would not survive the wound. So she grabs a broom from the kitchen and holds it up with a mind to strike the ghost with it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She inhales, ready to storm the ghost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She exhales. She inhales again, this time ready to storm the ghost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>She exhales. </span><span>Come on, Claude.</span><span>&nbsp;She inhales. </span><span class="c1">Don&rsquo;t think about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She bursts into the room, broom held high, but sees nothing. But as she relaxes she notices a wind passing through the room. Not a breeze but a wind, as if she stood on the high moor. It pulls on her hair and shirt, but it passes as quickly as it came on. Claude leaves to follow it out east of the house, but nomatter where she searches she cannot find the ghost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She repairs to her bed to find the blind girl sleeping soundly. She isn&rsquo;t sure if she should get back into bed with her and considers taking the girl&rsquo;s bed until she remembers the ghost. She falls asleep with the girl in her arms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The next morning she wakes to the cock&rsquo;s call and finds the girl has already made breakfast. The two talk as though nothing happened; they discuss which fruit they despise picking, which meats they have always longed to taste, and jokes or fables they&rsquo;ve heard on the road. &ldquo;Speaking of this,&rdquo; Claude says, &ldquo;I got you something&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Got me something?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claude retrieves a little bag from the larder and lays its contents on the table. The girl reaches her hands over to touch it - leather, firm, stiff&hellip; She runs her finger down its spine and flicks through the pages, the wind it makes moving her locks. &ldquo;A book!&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it. Read it to me instantly!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; says Claude, scratching behind her ear. &ldquo;I weren&rsquo;t so educated.&rdquo;</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The girl laughs. Soon they have devised a plan. Claude places her finger under the first letter of the book and describes its shape. &ldquo;A circle, where half the circle is missing.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The girl thinks it through, recalling the image where it had been absent for so long. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a </span><span class="c4">C</span><span class="c1">.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A circle driven by a line along the middle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an </span><span class="c4">e</span><span class="c1">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A circle flattened out with a hook on top.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;That must be an </span><span class="c4">a</span><span class="c1">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;A line with a hook pointing right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Does the hook close back on the line?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s like a fishing hook.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an </span><span class="c4">r</span><span class="c1">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Next is another </span><span class="c4">r</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;but after a little a room.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a space. You finished the word. </span><span class="c4">Cear?</span><span>&nbsp;Huh&hellip; Oh, it&rsquo;s </span><span class="c4">Dear.</span><span>&nbsp;That first letter was a </span><span class="c4">D</span><span>. It probably says </span><span class="c4">&lsquo;Dear reader&rsquo;</span><span class="c1">, it&rsquo;s an apology.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;An apology? What are they sorry for?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;For writing the book. They always are.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They don&rsquo;t get very far with the book when there&rsquo;s a knock at the door. Claude jumps out of her seat. She looks like a woman in a nightmare. &ldquo;After all they must have followed me,&rdquo; she says quietly. &ldquo;We have to hide.&rdquo; The girl takes her wrist and brings her to the larder and they begin to move the sacks to make a hiding place for themselves, but Claude says &ldquo;What if they find the steer?&rdquo;, so go to the master bedroom where the steer is sleeping softly. All the while there has been knocking on the door.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No one keeps a cow in their house, Claude. If they see it they&rsquo;ll be suspicious no matter what&rsquo;s happened.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go out the back and hide over the hill.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Claude opens the back door.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah, hello. You mustn&rsquo;t have heard me round the front.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Fuck.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry, sir. We have been setting the house right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You know, I said it to myself, I said &lsquo;no one has been here for years. Why look here?&rsquo; But something just made me think to come here. And after all I find you&rsquo;re here to restore it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So I was right to come. Looks like you really have your work cut out for you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, sir?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The man wears robes which are faded dull colours by the sun and silvery samite thrown over the shoulders. Claude recognizes him as a priest of Lathander. He explains that there has been a string of robberies and a murder in his diocese and all together that he&rsquo;s here to arrest Claude if only he knew it. He goes on to talk about the deceased and his family and matters of the parish and many other things that she wishes not to hear. &ldquo;Sorry, sir, that we couldn&rsquo;t be more help,&rdquo; she says, and closes the door.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She comes and puts her head on the steer&rsquo;s rump and lets out a long sigh. The steer twists around and licks her face and this time she doesn&rsquo;t push him away. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say anything about you,&rdquo; she says, scratching his ear. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so strange, despite what one may have said.&rdquo; The girl snorts, but she lies down in the hay with Claude and the animal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>For the next few rides they </span><span class="c6">[do everyday farm stuff]</span><span class="c1">, work on </span></p></body></html>
